### File Upload Screen
- Drag-and-drop zone with clear visual feedback
- File type indicators and validation messaging
- Selection area for left/right document assignment
- Clear hierarchy of actions and instructions
- Progress indicators for file processing

### Comparison View

#### Document Viewers
- Clean, minimal container design
- Sufficient padding and line spacing for readability
- Page indicators and navigation controls for PDFs
- Line numbers for markdown files
- Synchronized scrolling between panels
- Clear visual indication of current view mode

#### Difference Highlighting

- Visual differentiation between warnings and critical errors
- Placeholder content that demonstrates app functionality

## Design Deliverables
- Component library in Figma or similar design tool
- Interactive prototype for core user flows
- Design tokens for colors, typography, spacing
- Dark/light mode variations
- Responsive breakpoint specifications
- Animation specifications for key interactions
