# Document Comparison Tool - Technical Requirements

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **UI Library**: React 18+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library**: Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: React Context API or Zustand

### Build & Development
- **Package Manager**: pnpm or npm
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in tooling
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript
- **Linting**: ESLint with Prettier

## Technical Components

### Core Architecture
- Single-page application (SPA) with client-side processing
- Component-based architecture following atomic design principles
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS flex/grid system
- Theme switching with Tailwind's dark mode support

### Document Handling

#### PDF Processing
- **Library**: PDF.js (Mozilla's PDF viewer)
- Functionality:
  - Document parsing and rendering
  - Text extraction for comparison
  - Page navigation
  - Zoom controls
  - Text layer for highlighting differences

#### Markdown Processing
- **Parsing**: Marked.js or Remark
- **Rendering**: React-Markdown
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Prism.js or Highlight.js
- Functionality:
  - Raw/rendered view toggle
  - Syntax highlighting in raw view
  - Line numbering for reference

### Comparison Engine
- **Diff Algorithm**: Implementation of Myers diff algorithm or use of diff-match-patch library
- Text normalization before comparison (optional whitespace ignoring)
- Character-level or word-level diff generation
- Metadata comparison for relevant document properties

### File Handling
- Browser FileReader API for client-side file reading
- File validation for type and size constraints
- No server uploads - all processing happens in browser
- Optional local storage for session persistence

### UI Components
- File upload dropzone with drag-and-drop support
- Side-by-side document viewers with synchronized scrolling
- Difference highlighting overlay
- Navigation controls for multi-page documents
- Theme toggle (light/dark)
- Responsive controls for mobile/tablet views

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of document pages for PDF files
- Web workers for off-main-thread processing of large documents
- Memoization of diff results to prevent redundant processing
- Virtualized rendering for large documents
- Progressive loading indicators for user feedback

## Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility
- Sufficient color contrast for highlighted differences
- Focus management for interactive components

## Browser Compatibility
- Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Responsive design for various screen sizes and devices

## Security Considerations
- No server-side storage or processing of user documents
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Sanitization of document content before rendering
- Clear privacy policy explaining client-side processing

## Future Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for additional document formats
- API design to allow for future server-side options
- Modular code structure to enable feature additions
