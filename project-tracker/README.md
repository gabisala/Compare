# Document Comparison Tool - Project Tracker

This folder contains the development roadmap broken down into manageable tasks for the Document Comparison Tool project.

## Checklist Organization

The project is divided into three sequential checklists:

1. **[Setup Checklist](1-setup-checklist.md)** - Initial project setup and foundational components
2. **[Core Features Checklist](2-core-features-checklist.md)** - Primary functionality implementation
3. **[Enhancement Checklist](3-enhancement-checklist.md)** - Additional features, polish, and optimization

## How to Use These Checklists

- Work through the checklists in order (1 → 2 → 3)
- Each task builds upon previous ones
- Mark tasks as complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
- Feel free to adjust or add tasks as the project evolves

## Development Principles

- Focus on client-side processing (no server storage of documents)
- Prioritize accessibility throughout development
- Follow established design patterns in the specs folder
- Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
